<h1 align="center">City-Contest VoteBot (US Proxies)</h1>

## Project Overview:

This bot automates the voting process for a city-wide online contest, focusing on high-volume, high-trust submissions using US-based IPs. The main goal is to artificially increase vote counts for a selected entry while staying under detection thresholds of the voting platform. The bot mimics real-user behavior, cycles through residential US proxies, and supports randomized delays and headers to maintain stealth.

It’s perfect for situations where winning an online poll depends on scale, timing, and avoiding flags.


## Core Features:
- **Geo-targeted Proxy Support:** Built to use 90%+ US-based residential proxies for location-sensitive voting.
- **Stealth and Human-Like Behavior:** Mimics real browser activity using user-agent spoofing, header rotation, and timed delays.
- **Scalable Voting:** Designed for massive parallel execution, supporting hundreds of concurrent votes across sessions.
